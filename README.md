# ConferenceScheduler

This java application allows for the scheduling of conferences by providing an interface for attendees and speakers to register, sign up for events and give talks. Running it runs an installation of MySQL with detalied instructions in the README folders inside of the `phase1`,`phase2` directories. Several real world design patterns were implemented.

This was a collaborative final project with the following people at the University of Toronto

* Neil Gupta
* Rohit Prakash
* Jordan Botines
* Elijah Bishun
* Joshua Emerson
* Jayden Ong
* Khushkaran Rajput
