===== GETTING STARTED =====
    Welcome to the program! If you have not set up the MySQL database, follow the Appendix at the bottom of the file. We begin in ProgramMain. Run the main method and let's begin.

    You will be asked if you would like to read from a file or not:
    If you choose to read from a file, you will be reading from the presets we have provided. See below for details.
    If you choose not to, you will be starting from scratch.

    Follow the prompts on screen for either option. See the defaults provided and adding user section below for
    conditions and additional details.

    You are now asked if you would like to sign in as a new or existing user.
    The new user option is for registering a new account and existing user is for logging in as an existing user.
    If you decide to create a new user, see the new user account conditions section.
    If working with the defaults provided and signing in as an existing user, see the defaults section below
    for the usernames and passwords of existing users.

    The following section is about specific users and what they can do:


===== SETTING UP MySQL =====
    === Windows ===
    Download the MySQL Community Server installer here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html
    Follow instructions
        During the Choose a Setup Type, select custom
        Add the following three files
            MySQL Server x64
            MySQL Java Connector (J/Connector)
            Under applications, MySQL Shell x64
    Leave everything else as default
    It will ask you to set up a password during the installation phase, make sure you remember the password
    Make sure you know where the files are being saved
    Complete the installation
    If you have not set up a password, open up MySQL Installer and press reconfigure next to the server.
    Leave everything as default until you are asked to enter your password.
    Apply the configuration and exit the installer.
    Open the MySQL Command Line Client
    Enter your password
    Enter the following
        CREATE DATABASE conference;
        exit;

    === MacOS ===
    Download the MySQL Community Server here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/8.0.html
        Select the DMG Archive Version
        Start installation
        It will ask you to create a password, make sure you remember it
        Leave everything else as default
        Complete installation
    Open System Preferences
    MySQL should appear in the bottom row
    Click it, then start the server
    Open the terminal
    Type the following
        echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
        . ~/.bash_profile
    Then type the following
        mysql -u root -p
    Enter the password you created during installing
    Enter the following
        CREATE DATABASE conference;
    Download the Connector/J here https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ (use platform independent,
    ZIP is probably easier)

    === Both Platforms ===
    Open IntelliJ and the project file
    In the project pane, right click the project file (the top level file on the project pane)
    Open Module Settings
    Select libraries
    Select the + button
    Select Java
    Navigate to wherever your Connector/J file is and find the mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar file and select it
    Open the CreateConferenceTables java file in the saver package
    Change the password on line 16 to your password (the third string)
    Run the main method in this file
    Open the Connector java file
    Again, in the constructor look for the spot to enter your password again
    The program is now ready to run

===== DESIGN PATTERNS USED =====
1. Factory Design Pattern: UserFactory (used in UserManager) and EventFactory (EventManager)
2. Dependency Injection: Controllers of all Users (created instances of the users elsewhere and pass them in to the controller rather than hard coding them)
3. AttendeeController, SpeakerController, OrganizerController, VIPController
4. Liskov Substitution Principle: Lists, Maps, Set (vs ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet) - eventManager, messageManager, userManager, Event, Users
5. Single Responsibility Principle - Message, Event, User (Attendee, Organizer, Speaker, VIP), Request, Room


===== APPENDIX: SETTING UP THE MYSQL DATABASE =====
1. Download and install the MySQL Community Server here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
2. Under your 'System Preferences' (OS Dependent) make sure the server is running.
3. Run the mysql binary in the command line (on mac this is at /usr/local/mysql/bin/ with the command `mysql -u root -p`) and enter the password created during installation. This creates and account with username 'root' and your particular password.
4. In MySQL run 'CREATE DATABASE conference;' and exit.
5. In CreateConferenceTables.java and Connector.java, put in your password. The default is csc@207uoft. If you ran the correct MySQL command, the username remains root.
6. Open up Project settings and make a new Java library with the file JDBC/mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar
7. Run CreateConferenceTables.main(). This syncs the MySQL database with the project.
8. Run ProgramMain.main() and everything should work.
